Experimental canvas-based mapping library.

Two quick demos:

* [Dragging](http://bl.ocks.org/1177827)
* [Scrolling](http://bl.ocks.org/1177880)

The API is still a work in progress; for example, I expect to change the image layer so that it is bound to a canvas element, rather than rendering once per callback.
